# Darkent_traffic_classification
This project is focused on the classification of darknet traffic through the implementation and evaluation 
of various algorithms, both machine learning and deep learning. Through meticulous experimentation 
and analysis, we sought to identify the most effective approach for distinguishing darknet activities. 
The comparison of algorithm performances provided valuable insights into their strengths and 
weaknesses in handling the intricacies of darknet traffic, and the features each algorithm considers 
more significant.
